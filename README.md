Model Banking Application

Introduction:
This GitHub repository contains a Java banking application that provides essential functionalities for managing bank accounts. It includes features such as opening an account, depositing and withdrawing money, taking loans, updating account details, calculating interest, and deleting accounts.

Concepts Used:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The application utilizes OOP principles with classes like BankDetails for account management and Bank_Application for application control.
Encapsulation: Private instance variables and methods encapsulate data and operations within the BankDetails class, ensuring data integrity and security.
Inheritance: Although not explicitly shown, the application can be extended to include inheritance for different types of bank accounts (e.g., savings, checking).
Exception Handling: Input validation is implemented using conditional statements to handle invalid user inputs.
User Authentication: The application incorporates a simple username-password authentication system to access banking functionalities.

Features:
Account Management: Users can open, view, update, and delete their bank accounts.
Transaction Handling: Includes deposit, withdrawal, and loan functionalities with appropriate validations.
Interest Calculation: Automatically calculates and adds interest to account balances.
Authentication: Provides secure access to banking features with username-password authentication.
User-Friendly Interface: Utilizes a menu-driven interface for easy navigation and interaction.

Future Enhancements:
Improved User Interface: Enhance the user interface with graphical elements using Java Swing or JavaFX for a more modern and intuitive user experience.
Multi-Account Support: Extend the application to support multiple accounts per user, allowing for better account management.
Transaction History: Implement a transaction history feature to track and display account transactions.
Security Enhancements: Integrate more robust security measures such as encryption for sensitive data and secure communication protocols.
Reporting and Analytics: Add features for generating account statements, financial reports, and analytics for better financial management.

Conclusion:
This Java banking application serves as a foundation for building a comprehensive banking system. By leveraging OOP concepts, user authentication, and essential banking functionalities, it provides a solid framework that can be further enhanced and customized to meet specific banking needs. With future enhancements like improved UI, multi-account support, and advanced security measures, the application can evolve into a robust and user-friendly banking solution.
